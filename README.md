Safekeep repository of a incomplete RPG project

pyRPG (or Projeto RPG) is a abandoned python RPG in portuguese coded from 2013/2014
Most scripts doesn't do their whole jobs, but have some basis for what had been planned and can be seen as templates for systems... but they don't use much of a design patters to be actually useful

It has two versions (or better... two attempts..) to make the RPG, each one have different working parts

What (kinda) works:
- Combat system (basic 3 attack buffer works and end of battle not all actions works)
- Main menu (but doesn't start a game...)
- Map and movement (but not a actual place to walk around)
- Biblio series of files as functions for actions, items and monsters
- Ttinker script for a main menu with User Interface
